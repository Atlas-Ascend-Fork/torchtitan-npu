"""CANN compressor using the operator's native autograd implementation.

The fused kernel compresses one local stream, addressed by that stream's own ``cu_seqlens``: the
ratio-4 overlap's carry is not its business (``CarryExchange`` prepends the
predecessor block, passes the augmented boundaries and trims the extra output block), so this
module has no process group and no CP branch.  The kernel's zero tiling table is an operator
input built here, from the stream's own shape symbols, never from a host maximum that a traced
graph would bake in; the model-level compressor interface does not know it exists.
