"""The DeepSeek-V4 fused attention's metadata: the AI_CPU records only.

The model-dir entry (``models/deepseek_v4/metadata.py``) owns the row and its frames; this
module owns exactly what the AscendC kernels add to it, grouped by the consumer that launches
it -- one group per pair of kernels, one field per direction::

    aicpu_metadata
    + sparse_attn
      + fwd   -> sparse_flash_mla
      + bwd   -> sparse_flash_mla_grad
    + lightning_indexer
      + fwd   -> lightning_indexer / quant_lightning_indexer (the selector's own backend states it)
      + bwd   -> sparse_lightning_indexer_kl_loss_grad

``AicpuGeometry``
    the static numbers the AI_CPU operators are called with (heads, head dim, window, and the
    selector's widths).  It lives beside them because the context-parallel transform is handed the
    metadata alone and must rebuild it for this rank's frames; nothing in the forward or the
    backward reads it.

``AicpuMetadata``
    the AI_CPU operator outputs of one geometry, grouped by consumer, plus the geometry they were
    sized with.

``AscV4Metadata``
    the model row with this geometry's records attached; it adds ``aicpu_metadata`` and nothing
    else.  Under context parallelism its ``prepare_cp_metadata`` rebuilds both the frames and the
    records for this rank.

The compressor has no frames here: the ratio-4 overlap's carry is applied outside the compressor
(``models/common/carry_exchange.CarryExchange``), which builds the augmented
boundaries and the kernel's state table at the call site and passes them as arguments.  The
quantized selector is another backend: it owns an entry of its own (a subclass of this one) and
rebuilds the selector group with its own contract.  Nothing here knows about quantization.
