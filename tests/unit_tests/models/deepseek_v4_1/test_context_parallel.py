"""The V4.1 context-parallel layout: the plan, the permutation, the frames, their invariants.

The layout is one packed row's coordinate change, so every property worth pinning is
checkable without a device and without a process group: which rows a rank ends up holding,
that the shard's permutation lands on exactly those rows, that the movement is a permutation
of the slab, that the receive side's closed form agrees with the row-by-row derivation, and
that the frames say the queries are the chunks while the KV streams stay the row.

The per-layer restore's collective is emulated in process, from the plan's own tables -- the
same tables the forward hands to ``all_to_all_single``.
